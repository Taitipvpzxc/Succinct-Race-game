Succinct Race
Succinct Race is a fast-paced, arcade-style racing game built using Python and Pygame. The game challenges players to control a car on a constantly moving road, avoiding obstacles while managing speed and handling. With a variety of mechanics, such as drifting and a dynamic road layout, players need to stay sharp as they navigate through the course.

This is a fun racing game with a cryptographic twist! You’ve got a smooth combination of arcade-style racing mechanics, drifting, and even zero-knowledge "proofs" for collision detection.

Features:
Responsive Controls: Move your car left, right, accelerate, and decelerate with simple keyboard inputs (W/S for speed, A/D for direction).

Drifting Mechanic: Press the space bar to enter drift mode, making tight turns while controlling the car's movement.

Random Obstacles: Watch out for oncoming cars and pink crabs that spawn randomly on the track.

Tachometer: A functional tachometer that visually tracks your car's speed in real time.

Humorous Comments: Enjoy random funny comments displayed during gameplay, often related to cryptocurrency and driving culture.

Dynamic Road: The road constantly scrolls, with the speed increasing as the game progresses.

Game Over & Restart: The game ends when the player crashes into an obstacle, but pressing "R" will restart the game.

S / Down Arrow: Decelerate

D / Right Arrow: Move Right
